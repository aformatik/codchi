repository is mandatory. Codchi will try to guess the rest of the information and prompt you if
neccessary."#,
        after_long_help = r#"
### Which nixpkgs should I use?
Since every code machine is a NixOS system, it needs a version of nixpkgs (the
collection containing all Nix programs). There are two options:

1. Use Codchi's nixpkgs: Every release of codchi has a pinned version of nixpkgs which
   is consistent across all code machines on a given host system. Because the Nix store
   is shared among all machines, this results in fewer package downloads, saves disk
   space and is faster during installation or updates. The downside is that code
   machines aren't perfectly reproducibile anymore, since the nixpkgs version can
   change with every Codchi version. In reality this shouldn't be a big deal because
   Codchi adheres to NixOS's release schedule (every 6 months) and keeps nixpkgs
   consistent across this timespan.
2. Use the module's nixpkgs: If a module of a code machine has a nixpkgs input inside its
   `flake.nix`, the code machine can use (Nix language: "follow") it.
    - Pro: Exact reproducibility among machines with the same module and nixpkgs.
    - Con: More packages to download, more disk space and slower during installation and updates.

Sometimes there is the need for user-specific variables and / or secrets, which should not be
included inside the .nix files inside a git repository, but they're still needed for the
development environment. An example is a GitHub / GitLab token which is used to automatically
setup mail and username for Git's config.

        long_about = r#"
Each code machine has a list of modules (often just one) which are identified by a name. There can
also be machines without modules (a base machine). You can add, modify, remove a module or switch a
module between local and remote configuration.
        "#,
        after_long_help = r#"
### Local Configuration

While working on a code machine module, any change to the code must first be pushed online before
Codchi can pull and apply the change. This can quickly become annoying, especially if you're
actively developing the module or experimenting a lot. Luckily, a machine module can be switched to
local repository inside the code machine.

It's good practise to have the `.nix` configuration files in the repository of your project itself.
This way Codchi can spin up a machine for every commit of your project. Also you'll have the
project checked out in your code machine anyway, so step 1 shouldn't be neccessary.

1. First of all, clone the repository containing the module configuration inside <MACHINE_NAME>.
   For Codchi to be able to find it, the repository has reside in a folder inside the machine's
   `$HOME`, which is `/home/codchi`.
```
git clone https://github.com/my/repo ~/my-project-name
```

2. Upon creation of <MACHINE_NAME>, if you didn't explicitly specify a module name for your
   repository, Codchi guesses a name from its url. List <MACHINE_NAME>'s modules to get the actual
   module name:
```bash
codchi module list <MACHINE_NAME>
┌─────────────┬────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐
│ Name        ┆ Url                ┆ Flake Module           │
╞═════════════╪════════════════════╪════════════════════════╡
│ repo-module ┆ github.com/my/repo ┆ nixosModules.my-module │
└─────────────┴────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```
3. Now you can tell Codchi to switch the module pointing to the remote repository to your local
   copy. Note that that 'my-project-name' is the path inside <MACHINE_NAME> relative to $HOME:
```bash
codchi module set <MACHINE_NAME> <MODULE_NAME> --url=my-project-name
```

If you don't already have a module (e.g. after creating a base machine), you can just add a module
pointing to a local repository. The name of the new module will be inferred by Codchi:
```bash
codchi module add <MACHINE_NAME> my-project-name
```

    #[clap(
        about = "Apply changes to a code machine. \
By default this also fetches updates for each module.",
        long_about = r#"
When a code machine is modified, it needs to be rebuilt in order to apply the changes.
Modifications include:

- A module was added, modified or removed
- The configuration of a remote module was modified
- The configuration of a local module was modified

To prevent the fetching of updates, use `--no-update`.

codchi rebuild <MACHINE_NAME>
```

### Running graphical programs

Programs which provide shortcuts (usually graphical programs) are added to your host's system menu
as shortcuts and can be started by clicking them.

Run `PROGRAM [ARGS...]` inside <MACHINE_NAME>:
```
codchi exec <MACHINE_NAME> PROGRAM [ARGS...]

For example, `uname -a`:
```
codchi exec <MACHINE_NAME> uname -a
```
If some options conflict with Codchi's options, you can escape them with `--`:
```
codchi exec <MACHINE_NAME> -- PROGRAM [ARGS...]
```
"#
    )]
    Exec {
        /// Name of the code machine
        name: String,

        group(ArgGroup::new("exclusive").args(&["all", "machines"])),
        about = "Perform garbage collection of old nix store paths.",
        long_about = r#"
All programs and system files reside in the append-only Nix Store. Over time the store will grow in
size noticably, because everytime a `codchi rebuild` is run, new files get added to the store.
Therefore you might want to perform a garbage collection from time to time.

By default, garbage collection will **not** delete old machine generations in order to allow
instantaneous rollbacks. The drawback is that the store paths refered to in the old generations
never get freed. To also delete old generations, use `--delete-old` with an optional minimum age
(in days). Note that only explicitly listed machines (`MACHINES...`) will be processed. To
process all installed machines, use `--all`.

### WARNING
In Codchi, the Nix Store is shared across all code machines, which means that the garbage collector
also shares a directory of roots ("gcroots") that should be preserved, such as the current system
configuration of each code machine. On a vanilla NixOS system, local gcroots (such as those created
by `nix build` or direnv) are automatically registered and protected from garbage collection.
However, this doesn't work in Codchi at the moment, because the garbage collector has a different
view on the file system of each code machine. As a result, the local gcroots of individual machines
become invalid. For example, a gcroot pointing to `/home/codchi/result` on machine `foo` is invalid
from the perspective of Codchi, as the correct path would be `/data/machine/foo/result`.

This isn't a huge issue, as the deleted store paths can be redownloaded or rebuilt.
"#,
        after_long_help = r#"
### Large WSL Distributions

On Windows, the store is inside the WSL distribution 'codchistore'. By default WSL distributions
only grow in size, once used disk space is not automatically reclaimed. Codchi will try to set the
distribution to sparse mode which should automatically free unused space. If this doesn't work, you
can do it automatically with
```bash
wsl.exe --manage codchistore --set-sparse true
```
Beware that WSL needs to be shut down for this which will close all running Linux programs.

If sparse mode somehow doesn't work correctly, you can manually shrink a WSL distribution like this:
```ps1
wsl.exe --terminate codchistore
diskpart # this will need admin rights
select vdisk file="C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local\codchi\store\ext4.vhdx"
compact vdisk
exit
```

# EXAMPLES

Delete generations older than one month of <MACHINE_1> and <MACHINE_2>:
```
codchi gc --delete-old 30 <MACHINE_1> <MACHINE_2>
```
Delete all but the current generation from each installed machine:
```
codchi gc --all --delete-old
```

### Personal modules

Sometimes you might want to customize a code machine, but don't want to commit it to upstream to
the main module of the code machine which is also used by other developers. For example, you might
want to use a different editor than the rest of the project's contributors. Fortunately, you can
add as many modules to a machine as you like! This is especially handy for sharing your personal
configuration between different code machines:
```
codchi module add <MACHINE_NAME> https://github.com/my/cool/nixconfig nixosModules.vim
```

### Local modules
See the **EXTRA** section of `codchi module` for more information.
Given you already have a git repository containing a code machine module checked out inside
<MACHINE_NAME> at the path `$HOME/my-additional-module`. You can add it to the code machine via:
```bash
codchi module add <MACHINE_NAME> my-additional-module <MODULE_PATHS...>
```
**Note that the <URL> (`my-additional-module`) is relative to `$HOME` inside <MACHINE_NAME> and has
no leading `~` or `./`.** If you leave <MODULE_PATHS...> empty, Codchi will prompt you with a list
of available modules, just like with `codchi init`.

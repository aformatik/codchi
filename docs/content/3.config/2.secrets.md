# Secrets

Sometimes there is the need for user-specific variables and / or secrets, which should not be included inside the `.nix` files inside a git repository, but they're still needed for the development environment. An example is a GitHub / GitLab token which is used to automatically setup mail and username for Git's config.

With Codchi these secrets can be *described* via NixOS options. Lateron, when a user installs a machine with this config, Codchi will prompt him to enter the specific secret value. The value is then made available via environment variables inside the machine.

**Warning**

Codchi stores secret values in plain text on the host. Also they are available via plain environment variables inside a code machine. Therefore they should not be used for super sensitive secrets.

Here's an example:

```nix
# configuration.nix
{
  codchi.secrets.env.TEST = {
      description = ''
        This is an example secret. Please enter a random value!
      '';
  };
}
```
We define the secret `TEST` and provide a description. When we build this code machine, we'll be prompted for a value for `TEST`:
```bash
> codchi rebuild foo
...
? Please enter secret 'TEST' (Toggle input mask with <Ctrl+R>): My Secret Value
[This is an example secret. Please enter a random value!]
...

> codchi exec foo
[codchi@nixos:~]$ env | grep CODCHI
CODCHI_TEST=My Secret Value
...
```

We can also use this secret inside systemd services (which run automatically on machine startup). For this we have to source `/etc/codchi-env` on service startup:
```nix
# configuration.nix
{ 
  systemd.services.my-secret-service = {
    description = "My Service which reads Codchi's secrets";
    wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];

    script = ''
      source /etc/codchi-env
      echo "Got secret CODCHI_TEST=$CODCHI_TEST from codchi"
    '';
  };
}
```

We can view the latest log lines of the service:
```bash
[codchi@nixos:~]$ sudo systemctl status my-secret-service.service
○ my-secret-service.service - My Service which reads codchi's secrets

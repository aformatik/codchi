# Installation

## Windows 10 & 11

### Prerequisites

On Windows, Codchi uses the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl), which is available for free from Microsoft.

::alert{type="warning"}
Installing WSL enables Microsoft's Hyper-V Hypervisor, which might cause issues with older virtualisation technologies like VMware. Don't worry, you can [disable or re-enable Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/application-management/virtualization-apps-not-work-with-hyper-v) at any time.
::

Make sure that WSL2 is installed and up to date. In a terminal, `wsl.exe
--version` should output something like the following, where WSL-Version
should be `2.0.14` or greater:
```ps1
WSL-Version: 2.0.14.0
Kernelversion: 5.15.133.1-1
WSLg-Version: 1.0.59
MSRDC-Version: 1.2.4677
Direct3D-Version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore-Version: 10.0.25131.1002-220531-1700.rs-onecore-base2-hyp
Windows-Version: 10.0.22631.3296
```
If WSL is not installed:
```ps1
wsl.exe --install --no-distribution --web-download
```
If WSL is installed but too old:
```ps1
wsl.exe --update --web-download
```
Now recheck `wsl.exe --version`.

### Install Codchi

Download, open and install the latest
[codchi.msix](https://github.com/aformatik/codchi/releases/latest/download/codchi.msix). `MSIX` or
`AppX` is the packaging format for Windows Apps and should work out of the box.
Windows even handles subsequent updates of Codchi automatically, but you can
download and install a newer codchi.msix at any time.

### Shell Completions

On some Windows Systems running PowerShell scripts is considered a security vulnerability and often completely disabled. Therefore Codchi doesn't try to automatically run PowerShell scripts and you have to manually add the following to the end of your PowerShell configuration (find it by running `$PROFILE` in PowerShell):

```ps1
Invoke-Expression (& codchi completion powershell | Out-String)
```

#### Further Recommendations

- For better tab complete and history search:
    ```ps1
    # Shows navigable menu of all options when hitting tab
    Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete

    # Autocompletion for arrow keys (when something was already typed)
    Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -Function HistorySearchBackward
    Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key DownArrow -Function HistorySearchForward
    ```
- Install [Starship.rs](https://starship.rs/) for a better prompt


## Linux

### Prerequisites

On Linux Codchi uses [LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd) for virtualisation.
Follow the official [installation instructions](https://canonical.com/lxd/install)
until `lxd init`.

### Install Codchi

Currently, Codchi is only packaged with [Nix](https://nixos.org) on Linux. 

Install Nix (uses the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)):
```bash
# with SystemD:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
# without SystemD:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install --init none
```

Now install codchi (omit `--accept-flake-config` to not use Codchi's binary cache):
```bash
nix --accept-flake-config profile install github:aformatik/codchi
```

### Shell Completions

When installed via Nix, shell completions should automatically work inside bash, zsh and fish. There are also [completions](../2.usage/completion.md) available for the following shells which must be installed manually by the user:

- carapace
- elvish
- fig
- nushell

For example for elvish:
```bash
eval (codchi completion elvish | slurp)
```

## NixOS

### Prerequisites

Flakes need to be activated.

Install LXD and add codchi's binary cache (optional but faster):
```nix
virtualisation.lxd.enable = true;
virtualisation.lxc.lxcfs.enable = true;
virtualisation.lxd.recommendedSysctlSettings = true;

# Allow your user to use LXD
users.users.<your user>.extraGroups = [ "lxd" ];

# optional but recommended:
nix.settings = {
  extra-substituters = [ "https://codchi.cachix.org" ];
  trusted-public-keys = [ "codchi.cachix.org-1:dVwdzogJgZO2x8kPKW02HNt2dpd/P/z46pY465MkokY=" ];
};

# If you use a local DNS server. See https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/263359
networking.firewall.interfaces.lxdbr0.allowedTCPPorts = [ 53 ];
networking.firewall.interfaces.lxdbr0.allowedUDPPorts = [ 53 67 ];
```
Now, `nixos-rebuild`. Then run `lxd init` manually.

### Shell Completions

Shell completions should automatically work inside bash, zsh and fish, provided that shell completion is enabled:
```nix
{
    programs.bash.enableBashCompletion = true;
    programs.zsh.enableBashCompletion = true;
    programs.fish.vendor.completions.enable = true;
}
```
There are also [completions](../usage/completion.md) available for the following shells which must be installed manually by the user:

- carapace
- elvish
- fig
- nushell

For example for nushell (via home-manager):
```nix
{ pkgs, inputs, ... }: {
    programs.nushell.extraConfig = ''
        source ${pkgs.runCommand "codchi-nushell-complete" {} ''
          ${inputs.codchi.packages.${pkgs.system}.default}/bin/codchi complete nushell > $out
        ''}
    '';
}
```

### Install Codchi

In your flake.nix:
```nix
inputs.codchi.url = "github:aformatik/codchi";
inputs.codchi.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

outputs = inputs@{ ... }: {
    # Pass inputs to your NixOS configuration (e.g. via extraArgs)
};
```
In your NixOS configuration:
```nix
{ inputs, ... }: {
  environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.codchi.packages.x86_64-linux.default ];
}
```

## MacOS

::alert{type="info"}
Currently not implemented. Possible Drivers are <https://orbstack.dev/> (proprietary) and <https://lima-vm.io/> (open source, limited support for the newer faster virtualisation on Macs)

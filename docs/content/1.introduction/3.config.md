# Configuration

Codchi itself can be configured via the system tray icon or by editing:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\codchi\config.toml` (`%APPDATA%` is most likely `C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Roaming`)
- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/codchi/config.toml` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is most likely `~/.config`)

```toml [Minimal config.toml (All systems)]
# Just leave it empty to use the defaults. This is sufficient for most users
```

```toml [Complete config.toml (Windows)]
data_dir = 'C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\codchi'

tray.autostart = true

[vcxsrv]
enable = false
tray_icon = false
```

```toml [Complete config.toml (Linux)]
data_dir = "/home/me/.local/share/codchi"
tray.autostart = true
```

VcXsrv mostly has a better user experience and better performance but still has some bugs. Currently Codchi is shipped without VcXsrv due to security concerns, but it can be installed manually. It must be installed to `$env:ProgramData\VcXsrv`. |

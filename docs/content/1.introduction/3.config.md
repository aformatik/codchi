# Configuration

Codchi itself can be configured via the system tray icon or by editing:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\codchi\config.toml` (`%APPDATA%` is most likely `C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Roaming`)
- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/codchi/config.toml` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is most likely `~/.config`)

```toml [Minimal config.toml (All systems)]
# Just leave it empty to use the defaults. This is sufficient for most users
```

```toml [Complete config.toml (Windows)]
data_dir = 'C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\codchi'

enable_wsl_vpnkit = false;
tray.autostart = true

[vcxsrv]
enable = false
tray_icon = false
```

```toml [Complete config.toml (Linux)]
data_dir = "/home/me/.local/share/codchi"
tray.autostart = true
```

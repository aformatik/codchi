Codchi is a tool that manages your project's development environment. It uses the excellent   Nix package manager  to install, update, and roll back your project's development environment in a reproducible way - on any Windows or Linux machine. The development environments are defined in code and checked into your repository, allowing you to   share your environment   reproducibly  with your colleagues,  automate the installation and setup of the development environment,  check out a working development environment at every commit of your project.  Codchi uses virtualisation technologies like KVM and Hyper-V to provide an isolated environment while maintaining near-native performance and user experience of the tools (command-line as well as graphical) you're running. This means that Codchi can provide several versions of the development environment for the same project at the same time without polluting your host system.  Codchi's goal is to minimize the amount of thoughts you put into your development environment. Let's say the project you're working on is a Java web app that needs a JDK, an IDE like   IntelliJ IDEA , a web server and a database. With Codchi, the installation is as simple as providing the Codchi command-line interface with the link to the repository and waiting for a few minutes for the installation to finish. Now every time you launch the Java code machine - just in a terminal or via the automatically created shortcut directly into IntelliJ - the server and database are started and tools like the JDK are available. If at some point the tools in your development environment are updated or new ones are added, Codchi will keep track of the changes and provide the up-to-date environment. The reverse is also true: Reverting to an enviroment for any old commit in your project's history is as simple as checking out that commit.  How it Works  Code machines are to Codchi what containers are to Docker. A code machine is comprised of a number of   modules  (usually just one). A module is a plain NixOS Module inside a git repository which defines the development environment of that repository. Since it's just code, it is versioned just as the rest of the repository, which gives Codchi the ability to create a development environment for every commit of that project.    After configuration a code machine is built into a NixOS system inside a container. On Windows this is a WSL instance, on Linux a LXD container. The Codchi binary itself runs on the host system in order to provide features like passthrough of graphics and sound or start menu shortcuts for applications inside code machines. Also Codchi provides niceties like store-sharing between machines. In essence Codchi is a cross-platform driver for NixOS systems that takes care of the tedious hardware and system integration, so that you only have to think about the actual programs and services you want to run.  When should I (not) use Codchi?  It might seem that other tools like   devenv.sh  or   flox  already provide the exact same functionality as Codchi, but there are some important differences:    Nix Shell vs. NixOS : Tools like devenv.sh and flox provide the development environment in a (bash) shell without completely isolating them from the host. This is simpler and more performant than NixOS containers, but doesn't provide proper isolation which many, especially more complex enterprise development enviroments need.   User Experience : Both tools assume a Unix-like operating system with Nix already installed. Also often they assume an IDE like VSCode is already installed on the host system. Codchi on the other hand provides a \"single click installation\" which aims to be as user friendly as possible. Everything from the compiler and services to the IDE is provided when installing a code machine. Also since Codchi controls the virtualisation technology it can provide features like secret management and GPU computing by interfacing with the host OS.   Configuration : Codchi uses NixOS options while other tools have their own, much more limited option set. This means that in addition to Codchi's own options you can use   more than 10000 NixOS Options !  On the other hand, if it is a relatively simple development environment (e.g. projects that get by with only a LSP server and a few services) and it can be assumed that all developers have access to a Unix shell, simpler approaches such as simple Nix shells, devenv.sh or flox are more suitable.\nFurthermore, you can use both Codchi and devenv tools like devenv.sh and flox where they're best at: Codchi provides a consistent environment and proper host integration across Windows and Linux and devenv.sh or flox provide the development environment itself which can also be used outside of Codchi.",{"id":22,"path":23,"dir":14,"title":24,"description":7,"keywords":25,"body":30},"content:1.introduction:1.installation.md","/introduction/installation","Installation",[26,27,28,29],"Windows 10 & 11","Linux","NixOS","MacOS","  Installation  Windows 10 & 11  Prerequisites  On Windows, Codchi uses the   Windows Subsystem for Linux , which is available for free from Microsoft.   Installing WSL enables Microsoft's Hyper-V Hypervisor, which might cause issues with older virtualisation technologies like VMware. Don't worry, you can   disable or re-enable Hyper-V  at any time.  Make sure that WSL2 is installed and up to date. In a terminal,   wsl.exe --version  should output something like the following, where WSL-Version\nshould be   2.0.14  or greater:     WSL  -  Version:   2.0  .  14.0\n   Kernelversion:   5.15  .  133.1  -  1\n   WSLg  -  Version:   1.0  .  59\n   MSRDC  -  Version:   1.2  .  4677\n   Direct3D  -  Version:   1.611  .  1  -  81528511\n   DXCore  -  Version:   10.0  .  25131.1002  -  220531  -  1700.  rs  -  onecore  -  base2  -  hyp\n   Windows  -  Version:   10.0  .  22631.3296\n  If WSL is not installed:     wsl.exe   --  install   --  no  -  distribution   --  web  -  download\n  If WSL is installed but too old:     wsl.exe   --  update   --  web  -  download\n  Now recheck   wsl.exe --version .  Install Codchi  Download, open and install the latest\n  codchi.msix .   MSIX  or\n  AppX  is the packaging format for Windows Apps and should work out of the box.\nWindows even handles subsequent updates of Codchi automatically, but you can\ndownload and install a newer codchi.msix at any time.  Shell Completions  On some Windows Systems running PowerShell scripts is considered a security vulnerability and often completely disabled. Therefore Codchi doesn't try to automatically run PowerShell scripts and you have to manually add the following to the end of your PowerShell configuration (find it by running   $PROFILE  in PowerShell):     Invoke-Expression   (  &   codchi completion powershell   |   Out-String  )\n  Further Recommendations   For better tab complete and history search:\n     # Shows navigable menu of all options when hitting tab\n   Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler   -  Key Tab   -  Function MenuComplete\n   \n   # Autocompletion for arrow keys (when something was already typed)\n   Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler   -  Key UpArrow   -  Function HistorySearchBackward\n   Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler   -  Key DownArrow   -  Function HistorySearchForward\n  Install   Starship.rs  for a better prompt  Linux  Prerequisites  On Linux Codchi uses   LXD  for virtualisation.\nFollow the official   installation instructions \nuntil   lxd init .  Install Codchi  Currently, Codchi is only packaged with   Nix  on Linux.  Install Nix (uses the   Determinate Nix Installer ):     # with SystemD:\n   curl   --proto   '=https'   --tlsv1.2   -sSf   -L   https://install.determinate.systems/nix   |   sh   -s   --   install\n   # without SystemD:\n   curl   --proto   '=https'   --tlsv1.2   -sSf   -L   https://install.determinate.systems/nix   |   sh   -s   --   install   --init   none\n  You might want to add codchi's binary cache to speed things up (this step is optional):     nix-env   -iA   cachix   -f   https://cachix.org/api/v1/install\n   cachix   use   codchi\n  Now install codchi:     nix   profile   install   github:aformatik/codchi\n  Shell Completions  When installed via Nix, shell completions should automatically work inside bash, zsh and fish. There are also   completions  available for the following shells which must be installed manually by the user:   carapace  elvish  fig  nushell  For example for elvish:     eval   (codchi   completion   elvish   |   slurp  )\n  NixOS  Prerequisites  Flakes need to be activated.  Install LXD and add codchi's binary cache (optional but faster):     virtualisation  .  lxd  .  enable   =   true  ;\n   virtualisation  .  lxc  .  lxcfs  .  enable   =   true  ;\n   virtualisation  .  lxd  .  recommendedSysctlSettings   =   true  ;\n   \n   # Allow your user to use LXD\n   users  .  users  .\u003C  your   user  >.  extraGroups   =   [   \"lxd\"   ]  ;\n   \n   # optional but recommended:\n   nix  .  settings   =   {\n     extra-substituters   =   [   \"https://codchi.cachix.org\"   ];\n     trusted-public-keys   =   [   \"codchi.cachix.org-1:dVwdzogJgZO2x8kPKW02HNt2dpd/P/z46pY465MkokY=\"   ];\n   }  ;\n   \n   # If you use a local DNS server.

Then run   lxd init  manually.  Shell Completions  Shell completions should automatically work inside bash, zsh and fish, provided that shell completion is enabled:     {\n       programs  .  bash  .  enableBashCompletion   =   true  ;\n       programs  .  zsh  .  enableBashCompletion   =   true  ;\n       programs  .  fish  .  vendor  .  completions  .  enable   =   true  ;\n   }\n  There are also   completions  available for the following shells which must be installed manually by the user:   carapace  elvish  fig  nushell  For example for nushell (via home-manager):     { pkgs  ,   inputs  ,   ...   }: {\n       programs  .  nushell  .  extraConfig   =   ''\n           source   ${  pkgs  .  runCommand   \"codchi-nushell-complete\"   {}   ''\n             ${  inputs  .  codchi  .  packages  .  ${  pkgs  .  system  }  .  default  }  /bin/codchi complete nushell > $out\n           ''  }\n       ''  ;\n   }\n  Install Codchi  In your flake.nix:     inputs  .  codchi  .  url   =   \"github:aformatik/codchi\"  ;\n   inputs  .  codchi  .  nixpkgs  .  follows   =   \"nixpkgs\"  ;\n   \n   outputs   =   inputs@{   ...   }: {\n       # Pass inputs to your NixOS configuration (e.g. via extraArgs)\n   };\n  In your NixOS configuration:     { inputs  ,   ...   }: {\n     environment  .  systemPackages   =   [   inputs  .  codchi  .  packages  .  x86_64-linux  .  default   ];\n   }\n  MacOS   Currently not implemented.

Therefore you\nmight want to perform a garbage collection from time to time.  By default, garbage collection will   not  delete old machine\ngenerations in order to allow instantaneous rollbacks. The drawback is\nthat the store paths refered to in the old generations never get freed.\nTo also delete old generations, use   --delete-old  with an optional\nminimum age (in days). Note that only explicitly listed machines\n(  MACHINES... ) will be processed. To process all installed machines,\nuse   --all .  WARNING  In Codchi, the Nix Store is shared across all code machines, which means\nthat the garbage collector also shares a directory of roots (\"gcroots\")\nthat should be preserved, such as the current system configuration of\neach code machine. On a vanilla NixOS system, local gcroots (such as\nthose created by   nix build  or direnv) are automatically registered and\nprotected from garbage collection. However, this doesn't work in Codchi\nat the moment, because the garbage collector has a different view on the\nfile system of each code machine. As a result, the local gcroots of\nindividual machines become invalid. For example, a gcroot pointing to\n  /home/codchi/result  on machine   foo  is invalid from the perspective\nof Codchi, as the correct path would be   /data/machine/foo/result .  This isn't a huge issue, as the deleted store paths can be redownloaded\nor rebuilt.  Options    -d ,   --delete-old =  AGE  Delete old machine generations.

Since every code machine is a NixOS system, it needs a version of\nnixpkgs (the collection containing all Nix programs). There are two\noptions:   Use Codchi's nixpkgs: Every release of codchi has a pinned version\nof nixpkgs which is consistent across all code machines on a given\nhost system. Because the Nix store is shared among all machines,\nthis results in fewer package downloads, saves disk space and is\nfaster during installation or updates. The downside is that code\nmachines aren't perfectly reproducibile anymore, since the nixpkgs\nversion can change with every Codchi version. In reality this\nshouldn't be a big deal because Codchi adheres to NixOS's release\nschedule (every 6 months) and keeps nixpkgs consistent across this\ntimespan.  Use the module's nixpkgs: If a module of a code machine has a\nnixpkgs input inside its   flake.nix , the code machine can use (Nix\nlanguage: \"follow\") it.   Pro: Exact reproducibility among machines with the same module\nand nixpkgs.  Con: More packages to download, more disk space and slower\nduring installation and updates.

This\ncan quickly become annoying, especially if you're actively developing\nthe module or experimenting a lot. Luckily, a machine module can be\nswitched to local repository inside the code machine.  It's good practise to have the   .nix  configuration files in the\nrepository of your project itself. This way Codchi can spin up a machine\nfor every commit of your project. Also you'll have the project checked\nout in your code machine anyway, so step 1 shouldn't be neccessary.   First of all, clone the repository containing the module\nconfiguration inside . For Codchi to be able to find it, the\nrepository has reside in a folder inside the machine's   $HOME ,\nwhich is   /home/codchi .   git clone https://github.com/my/repo ~/my-project-name\n  Upon creation of , if you didn't explicitly specify a module name\nfor your repository, Codchi guesses a name from its url. List 's\nmodules to get the actual module name:   codchi module list \u003CMACHINE_NAME>\n┌─────────────┬────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐\n│ Name        ┆ Url                ┆ Flake Module           │\n╞═════════════╪════════════════════╪════════════════════════╡\n│ repo-module ┆ github.com/my/repo ┆ nixosModules.my-module │\n└─────────────┴────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘\n  Now you can tell Codchi to switch the module pointing to the remote\nrepository to your local copy. Note that that `my-project-name' is\nthe path inside relative to $HOME:   codchi module set \u003CMACHINE_NAME> \u003CMODULE_NAME> --url=my-project-name\n  If you don't already have a module (e.g. after creating a base machine),\nyou can just add a module pointing to a local repository.

So, configuring a code machine is the same as configuring a NixOS system, without you having to worry about hardware configuration.  A NixOS module is written in Nix's own configuration language with the same name. Nix (the language) can be described as \"JSON with functions\". To write your first Codchi module,   read   the tutorial  and look at   the examples  and the language specific chapters in this section.  If you want to get deeper into Nix, there is   the   official Nix Guide  the   NixOS Manual  and the   NixOS Wiki .  You can also as questions by    creating an GitHub issue  or in the   Nix Discourse .  During module development, you most likely don't want to push after every config change. To switch your code machine to your local working copy, see chapter   Local Configuration .

An example is a GitHub / GitLab token which is used to automatically setup mail and username for Git's config.  With Codchi these secrets can be   described  via NixOS options. Lateron, when a user installs a machine with this config, Codchi will prompt him to enter the specific secret value. The value is then made available via environment variables inside the machine.    Warning    Codchi stores secret values in plain text on the host. Also they are available via plain environment variables inside a code machine. Therefore they should not be used for super sensitive secrets.  Here's an example:     # configuration.nix\n   {\n     codchi  .  secrets  .  env  .  TEST   =   {\n         description   =   ''\n           This is an example secret.

When we build this code machine, we'll be prompted for a value for   TEST :     >   codchi rebuild foo\n   ...\n   ?   Please enter secret   'TEST'   (  Toggle   input   mask   with   \u003C  Ctrl+  R  >  ): My Secret Value\n   [This is an example secret.

For an overview of what Codchi is read   What is Codchi?  Overview  Technically Codchi is just a \"driver\" for any NixOS module, such as:     { \n   }\n  That is just an empty NixOS module. To build this into a bootable machine without Codchi, you need to provide the hardware configuration (e.g. file system layout, boot loader, kernel, kernel module & options, desktop environment, ...). This can vary a lot from machine to machine, although virtual machines alleviate some of this.  With Codchi, however, the empty module above is a buildable machine configuration on Windows 10 & 11 and Linux:     codchi   init   empty-machine\n   codchi   exec   empty-machine   --   uname   -a\n   >   Linux nixos 6.6.32   #1-NixOS SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sat May 25 14:22:56 UTC 2024 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n  This works because Codchi provides the hardware configuration, the drivers (i.e. WSL, LXD and so on), as well as host integration such as GUI and sound support, file system sharing between code machine and host, and much more.  The goal is to provide an easy to use NixOS driver for different platforms (currently Windows & Linux), where everything hardware related just works.  Capabilities  These are the capabilities provided by Codchi. Every new driver must at least fully implement the \"must\" items.     Category  Capability  Must / Should  Windows + WSL  Linux + LXD    Architecture  Each code machine on a host uses a shared store accessible via   nix-daemon  Must  ✅  ✅   Architecture  The file system of each code machine on a host can be accessed by the store for local NixOS configuration  Must  ✅  ✅   Run full NixOS  SystemD working properly  Must  ✅  ✅   Run full NixOS  Proper login shell, i.e.   codchi exec  creates a proper login shell with   $DISPLAY  set.  This is essential for the environment variables to be set correctly and for everything to start up correctly, including XDG autostart entries  Must  ✅  ❔   Host Integration  GUI & Sound:   codchi exec \u003CMACHINE_NAME> -- nix run nixpkgs#xorg.xeyes  must open xeyes on the host's desktop. X11 and wayland apps (with sound) must work.  Must  ✅  ❔   Host Integration  Tray icon: Codchi must be controllable through a tray icon on the host.  Must  ✅  ✅   Host Integration  Shortcuts to each program in each code machine must be visible in the host's start menu, such that GUI and terminal applications can be started with a single click.  Must  ✅  ✅   Host Integration  Terminal: Codchi must be integrated with the host's terminal, such that a terminal with a shell into each code machine can be opened from the codchi tray.  Must  ✅  ✅   Host Integration  Secrets: A code machine can define secrets, which the codchi driver must store (preferably encrypted) on the host and provide it on code machine start.  Must  ✅  ✅   Host Integration  File system sharing: The file system of each code machine should be accessible from the host, e.g. as with WSL.  Should  ✅  🚧 (Generally works through LXD, but UX can be improved)   Host Integration  GPU: If the host has a GPU driver installed, it should be usable from within a code machine.

Should  📝  📝   Legend   ✅ = Fully implemented and tested  ❔ = Implemented, but untestet / buggy  🚧 = WIP  📝 = Planned  ❌ = Not implemented  Drivers  A Codchi driver has three parts:    The host driver:  This is a part of the Codchi executable that runs natively on the host and interfaces between generic code, the operating system and the virtualization software. Codchi's configuration and machine data files also reside on the host and must be shared with   codchistore  and each code machine. Repository:   codchi ,   codchiw   The Store Driver:  The   codchistore  is a minimal container in which the shared store resides and machines are built. This is where   nix-daemon  runs.   codchistore  must share the   /nix  directory with each code machine via a bind mount. Repository:   nix/container/store   The Machine Driver:  The Codchi machine driver is just a NixOS module that acts as a bridge between a hardware agnostic NixOS module and the host's virtualization software (Windows: WSL, Linux: LXD). It must make the file system of the code machine available to   codchistore  in order to allow local NixOS configuration. The WSL part is heavily inspired by   NixOS-WSL . Repository:   nix/nixos/driver    Note    One thing to note is that since a code machine doesn't have its own store, it can only run if   codchistore  is also running, and should therefore only be started by Codchi.  WSL    SystemD:  WSL natively supports SystemD.   GUI:  Windows natively supports GUI applications within WSL with WSLg using a mixture of Wayland and RDP. Unfortunately, because of the latter, this doesn't really provide a native experience for Linux GUI applications.   Therefore, by default,   VcXsrv , a native Windows X server, is included and enabled in codchi. It can be disabled in   configuration .   1   Sound:  WSLg provides a PulseAudio server by default which works well enough.   File sharing:  Files are shared accross WSL instances via bind mounts in   /mnt/wsl/codchi .   Environment variables, secrets:  Shared via   $env:WSLENV  and a file which is written by the host driver to   \\\\wsl$\\codchi-*\\... .   Shortcuts:  Although WSL creates shortcuts itself, they only work if the code machine is already running. Therefore they are disabled and rather created by codchi itself so we can ensure that   codchistore  is running.   Terminal integration:    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/json-fragment-extensions   GPU:  WSL provides access to the GPU installed on the host via dynamic libraries and executables. Since a code machine is a NixOS system some LD hacks are neccessary.   Host Integration:  The default applications inside each code machine are configured such that files or webpages open in the default Windows browser    Issues with WSL    In the Windows tradition, WSL can sometimes fail for no apparent reason. For example, a Codchi command might fail, only to work when the same command is issued again. More work is needed in this area to catch all WSL hickups.  LXD    SystemD:  LXD doesn't care about the init system.   GUI:  X11 and wayland sockets are shared via bind mounts. Also   .Xauthority  is copied into each machine.   Sound:  PulseAudio / PipeWire sockets are shared.   File sharing:  All files reside on the host and are bind-mounted into   codchistore  and each machine.   Environment variables, secrets:  Shared via   lxc exec --env  and a file which is copied into the machine.   Shortcuts:  Desktop entries and menus are generated in the corresponding XDG directories.  VM Export    Planned    Integration with   nixos-generators  is planned to allow exporting a code machine to any / some VM format(s).  Codchi Modules  Codchi also provides its own set of [NixOS Options](../3.config/99.Codchi specific NixOS Options.md) in order to provide   Codchi-specific options (  codchi.secrets ,   codchi.welcome )  options to easy the creation of a development environment (  codchi.enableRecommendedConfig ,   codchi.docker ).  Repository:   nix/nixos/modules  Guidelines  These are the general design and contribution guidelines for Codchi. The goal is to make Codchi / NixOS easy to use and enjoyable while reducing the maintanence burden.    Reliable & Reproducible:  The native Codchi executable,   codchistore  and Codchi's NixOS configuration must be reliable. Quality of life features such as secrets must not affect the reproducibility of NixOS accross different hosts.   Fast   Easy to Use:   Features should be kept to a minimum.  Codchi should feel familiar (  git clone ,   docker exec ).   Building on Standards (NixOS modules):  No custom configuration format / vendor lock-in.   Simplicity:   Fewer but better features.  Simple design without a central Codchi-daemon.   Footnotes   Currently there are some security concerns in the GitHub repo of VcXsrv which is why it isn't included in Codchi by default anymore. But, if installed manually, it can still be used by Codchi (see   config ).   ↩  html .dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html.dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html .default .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}",{"id":317,"path":318,"dir":306,"title":319,"description":7,"keywords":320,"body":321},"content:4.contrib:roadmap.md","/contrib/roadmap","Roadmap",[],"  Roadmap   Bugs     shortcuts / terminal fragments win\n   update path on every update => autostart codchi tray => run \"migration\"  Future   Announcement Post (Discourse, Reddit)  Features       codchi status  on windows is slow\n=> move wsl status checking / store container starting to scheduled / time based task      codchi recover  => fs tar export      codchi debug  => machine / store debug shell      codchi export {vmware,virtualbox,qemu,hyperv} \n=> export machine to VM image\n=> backup / migrating away    (  codchi state export ) => creating a base fs for files like IJ / eclipse config    (codchi daemon inside each code machine)\n   current bash solution too fragile\n=> Does init (secret / config fetching, log reporting)    (Custom certs auto adding)\n   => how to handle inside code machines?
